    ICM-42688 motion tracking device.

    The properties included in this bindings file are the ones which are
    different in different device models. Common properties are included in
    invensense,icm4268x.yaml. When setting the accel-pm, accel-range,
    accel-odr, gyro-pm, gyro-range, gyro-odr properties in a .dts or .dtsi file
    you may include icm42688.h and use the macros defined there.

    Example:
    #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/sensor/icm4268x.h>

    icm42688: icm42688@0 {
      ...

      accel-pwr-mode = <ICM4268X_DT_ACCEL_LN>;
      accel-fs = <ICM42688_DT_ACCEL_FS_16>;
      accel-odr = <ICM4268X_DT_ACCEL_ODR_2000>;
      gyro-pwr-mode= <ICM4268X_DT_GYRO_LN>;
      gyro-fs = <ICM42688_DT_GYRO_FS_2000>;
      gyro-odr = <ICM4268X_DT_GYRO_ODR_2000>;
    };

    Where,
    ICM42688_DT_GYRO_FS_2000 represents +-2000 deg per sec
    as the full scale range of the gyroscope.

    ICM42688_DT_ACCEL_FS_16 represents +-16 times g as the maximum
    acceleration this device can measure.
