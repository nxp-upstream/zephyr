  Device-specific cache controller binding.

  This binding defines cache controllers that can be managed as individual
  device instances, providing fine-grained control over cache operations
  for different memory regions or purposes.

compatible: "zephyr,cache-device"

include:
  - base.yaml
  - cacheinfo.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Cache controller register base address and size.

  cache-windows:
    type: array
    description: >
      Base/size pairs describing external memory windows covered by this cache.
      The list must contain an even number of 32-bit values.

  dma-coherent:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Hint that memory served by this cache is coherent for DMA/data paths
      and does not require explicit device-cache maintenance. When present,
      the corresponding cache_device driver may choose to return -ENOTSUP
      from its range/all maintenance ops so that only CPU/sys cache is
      maintained while the device cache remains part of the generic model
      for topology and cache_info.
