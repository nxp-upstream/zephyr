menuconfig CACHE_DEVICE
	bool "Device-specific cache controller drivers"
	help
	  Enable support for device-specific cache controllers that can be
	  managed as individual device instances. This provides fine-grained
	  control over cache operations for different memory regions or purposes.

config CACHE_DEVICE_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Cache device initialization priority"
	default 60
	help
	  Cache devices initialization priority. This should be high enough to
	  ensure that cache devices are initialized after basic system services
	  but before devices that may depend on cache coherency.

config DEVICE_CACHE_INFO
	bool "Expose device cache information API"
	depends on CACHE_DEVICE
	default y
	help
		Enable cache_device_get_info() to return populated struct cache_info
		data for device-side caches. When disabled, cache_device_get_info()
		will return -ENOTSUP regardless of driver implementation. Keeping
		this enabled by default surfaces useful metadata (line size, size,
		ways) for performance tuning and diagnostics.
