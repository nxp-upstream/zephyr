	  This option enables the Cache64 device driver for NXP SOCs.
	  Cache64 is typically used for caching external flash memory
	  accessed via FlexSPI interface, providing improved performance
	  for external memory access.

	  The driver provides device-specific cache operations including:
	  - Enable/disable cache
	  - Flush and invalidate operations (all and range-based)
	  - Cache information retrieval
	  - FlexSPI memory region cache management
