	  Enable support for clock management drivers. These drivers provide
	  clock configuration to the system via a series of setpoints, which
	  allow drivers to configure clocks based on their desired power
	  state

	help
	  Allow clock consumers to request a given clock frequency via the
	  clock management framework. The framework will then configure the
	  clock tree so that the consumer is supplied with the closest
	  possible frequency to its request. Note that enabling this feature
	  will result in increased flash utilization
